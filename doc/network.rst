Networked usage
---------------

To use Camelot on multiple computers, the approach is to run Camelot on one
computer, and then connect to that computer over the network from all other
computers needing to use it. That is to say, Camelot itself is only ever
running on one computer, and other computers merely access Camelot over the
network. This is called a Client/Server model.

Camelot can be accessed by other computers on the network using the *address*
of the computer actually running Camelot.  The URL which web browsers may
connect to can be found in the |administration_ui|, under: **Camelot** â†’
**Known URLs**.

These addresses will change for each computer network Camelot is used
on. Alternatively, you can get the hostname or IP Address of your computer
manually (the process to do this is specific to each operating system &
outside the scope of this guide) and appending ":5341".

Using a similar approach, Camelot can be accessed remotely over the
Internet. This often necessitates use of a VPN or similar (configuring a VPN
Server is also outside of the scope of this guide and may require professional
IT services to set up).
