Terminology
-----------

The first time you run Camelot, you'll be taken to the 'Create Survey'
screen. Now would be good time to explain what a survey is, and some
other important concepts in Camelot.

-  **Survey**: a survey corresponds to a research project. All of the
   data collected will be part of a survey.
-  **Camera**: a single, physical camera. Each camera should be given a
   name and labeled.
-  **Camera Trap Station**: one or two cameras installed at a very
   specific location.
-  **Site**: a geographic area. Typically multiple camera trap stations
   will be in each site.
-  **Media**: a photo from a camera trap.

With terminology out of the way, onwards to creating a survey!
