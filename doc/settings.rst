Settings
--------

There are two types of settings available in Camelot:

# global settings, which affect all surveys, and
# survey settings, which are specific to a single survey

Global settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A variety of settings can be customised through Camelot's administration tool.
See |administration_ui| for more information.

Survey settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Survey details
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A survey can be configured via:

**Settings** → **Survey details**

Apart from the name and description, there is the option to configure the *sighting independence threshold*.  The sighting independence threshold is the number of minutes between two sightings where they may be classified *dependent*. Dependent sightings will be counted as a single sighting in some reports.

For more information about how the sighting independence threshold affects reports, see |indep_obs|.

Sighting fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sighting fields can be configured via:

**Settings** → **Sighting fields**

Sighting fields allow for the recording of additional information along with
each identification. This is a powerful tool, and is described in much more
detail |here|.
