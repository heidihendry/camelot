-  **Sighting Independence Threshold**: Camelot performs sighting
   independence checks on some reports. This setting controls the
   duration within which photos of the same species (and, if known, the
   same sex and life-stage) are considered dependent in those reports.
   Default is 30 minutes.
-  **Species name style**: *New in Camelot 1.1.0* whether species
   scientific or common names should be shown by default. Default is
   scientific names.
-  **Send anonymous usage data**: Enabled this option will provide data
   about how you use Camelot back to the Camelot Project. This data is
   anonymous and is used only for the purpose of improving Camelot. It
   is disabled by default, though if you have the consent of others
   using your Camelot instance, please consider enabling this.
